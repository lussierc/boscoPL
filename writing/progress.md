Since coming up with our project idea to create a mini-programming language grammar, scanner, and parser, we have completed a variety of tasks. We came up with some simple keywords and grammar to help us get started. We then created a sample program that will serve as a good basis for our language and also as a test program for our scanner and parser. Over the last couple of weeks we have begun to come up with ideas for our programming language grammar and it's scanner.

After our project was approved by Professor Jumadinova, we first came up with some ideas to include in our language. For instance we decided our programming language needed to include functions, data types (like integers, strings, and booleans), if/if else/else functionality, and loops. Additionally, we also saw the need language library functions (like printing and input gathering from the terminal) and comments. After this, we were able to proceed with coming up with reserved keywords and a simple grammar for our language.

Our reserved keywords included:
```

```

After determining our reserved keywords, we came up with a sample program to get a general idea of what our languages programs would like. We then began a simple parser for our language.
